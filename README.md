# 🧠 RIGOL MSO5000 Live Monitor (Hacked FW Compatible)

> **Current Version:** v0.9.7
> 📦 See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ariDev1/MSO5000_liveview/releases/tag/v0.9.7)

This tool provides a live view and SCPI-based data extraction from a **Rigol MSO5000** oscilloscope with **hacked firmware**, using VNC for screenshots and VISA (SCPI) for waveform data.

![Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)


**True power computation** is performed via pointwise multiplication of voltage and current waveforms followed by averaging:

# $P = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} v_n \cdot i_n$

This method remains accurate for arbitrary waveshapes and is not dependent on sinusoidal assumptions.

- 📤 CSV export of waveform data
- 🧪 **Long-time measurement mode with pause/resume/stop**  
  ↪️ Saves all data to a single timestamped CSV  
  ↪️ Timestamped rows at user-defined intervals  
  ↪️ Performance tips built into the UI
- 🧠 **Live Power Analyzer** with PQ chart and scaling  
  ↪️ Real-time P/S/Q/PF/Vrms/Irms calculations  
  ↪️ Probe scaling (shunt/clamp + unit conversion)  
  ↪️ Display of PF angle and cumulative energy  
  ↪️ Heatmap-style PQ trail with fading  
  ↪️ Shows `Reference: CURRENT` or `VOLTAGE` from scope
- 🐞 Scrollable debug log

## 📘 Whitepaper: Understanding Accurate Power Measurement

We published a technical whitepaper detailing how to achieve scientifically valid power analysis using the Rigol MSO5000 series oscilloscopes. It compares the internal PQ tool vs. our custom MSO5000 Live Monitor.

🔗 [Read the Whitepaper (Markdown)](docs/Rigol_Power_Analysis_Whitepaper.md)

> Covers probe configuration, scaling errors, and real-world lab results with shunts and differential probes.

## 🛠️ Installation (Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 Noble)

### 📦 Native Python Setup

```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk python3.12-venv

git clone https://github.com/ariDev1/MSO5000_liveview.git
cd MSO5000_liveview/
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

Or use the prewritten install script:

```bash
bash how-to-install.txt
```

> 💡 Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with Python 3.12 and VNC enabled on the Rigol scope.

### 🧓 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Compatibility

If you're using **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-tk libxcb-xinerama0
```

Then install dependencies manually:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pillow numpy pyvisa pyvisa-py requests vncdotool psutil zeroconf
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Support (X11 and Wayland compatible)

You can run this app in a **Docker container with GUI**.

### 🔧 Build the Image

```bash
docker build -t mso5000_liveview .
```

### 🚀 Run It

```bash
./run.sh
```

The script auto-detects X11 or Wayland and sets up display bridging.

### 📁 Where Are My CSV Files?

All exported CSV files go to:

```bash
~/oszi_csv/
```

This folder is mounted into the container.

---

## 📦 Python Requirements

Create a virtual environment first:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

# 📖 Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## v0.9.9-testing (2026-09-25)

### Qt viewer (feature/qt-ui)

- Tightened Harmonics and B-H setup rows: labels pair with their controls
  (shared `pair_label_control` helper, 2 px inner gap, trailing stretch).
- Unified the B-H fold: parameter grid and option row fold together, while
  `ACQUIRE & PLOT` / export actions stay visible like Power's `MEASURE` row.
- Reduced setup toggles to arrow-only (`▾`/`▸`) on all tabs.
- Harmonics table selection moves the blue `k=` plot marker instantly,
  including keyboard navigation (cached spectrum re-render, no re-measure).
- Footer shows human-friendly `SR 2.00 GSa/s · TB 200 µs/div` (raw SCPI kept
  in the tooltip).
- B-H trail uses the Tk-parity `plasma` age colormap instead of flat cyan.
- Status bar and debug log only refresh widgets on actual change (no more
  per-second full rebuilds).

### SCPI and waveform fetch

- Removed the circular self-import in `scpi/interface.py`.
- Dropped the discarded `:WAV:PRE?` priming query (one query per attempt,
  settling delay kept); hardware-verified on RAW and NORM captures.
- Fixed `fetch_waveform_with_fallback` to send `:WAV:POIN:MODE NORM` on the
  NORM path instead of hardcoded `RAW`.
- Merged the duplicated `Expected P (W)` tooltip in the Power tab.

## v0.9.8j-testing (2026-08-24)

### Verification and scientific integrity

- Added deterministic regression tests for the established power calculations.
- Added validation tests for empty, unequal-length, and non-finite waveform data.
- Preserved the established power formulas, shunt handling, clamp handling, and signed-power behavior.

### Scope display and analysis tools

- Replaced shell-based VNC capture with an argument-safe subprocess call.
- Added scope IPv4 address validation.
- Paused VNC capture while the scope image is hidden.
- Enabled the advanced B-H curve, harmonics, and noise inspector tabs by default.
- Improved the harmonics layout and added operator guidance to the noise inspector.
- Added power-analysis setup and standards-compatibility documents.

### Docker and release workflow

- Added X11 and Wayland launch checks with clear error messages.
- Made Docker build metadata reproducible from Git information.
- Aligned local and CI Docker builds with the same build procedure.
- Kept Docker publication limited to stable release tags.

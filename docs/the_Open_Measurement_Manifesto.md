# The Open Measurement Manifesto

## Engineering for Truth, Not for Approval

Since 2010, our mission has been to push the boundaries of what is possible in electrical engineering—not by chasing secrets, but by opening every step of the process to the world.

**We believe:**
- Measurement integrity is more important than reputation.
- Radical transparency is the foundation of scientific progress.
- Anyone, anywhere, should be able to test claims that matter.
- Real breakthroughs come from asking uncomfortable questions.

## Why We Build Open Tools

The MSO5000 Liveview Project, our B-H curve analyzer, and every line of code we release are **open source** and freely available.  
This is not a marketing slogan. It is the only way to ensure:

- **Replicability:**  
  Anyone can repeat our experiments, confirm or refute our results, and see every calculation and parameter for themselves.

- **Accountability:**  
  Our methods are visible, our assumptions explicit, our raw data available for public audit.

- **Community Empowerment:**  
  You don’t need to trust our claims—**you can test them**. We invite you to find errors, suggest improvements, and build on our work.

## Independent Validation

Our prototypes and systems have been **tested, measured, and analyzed by multiple independent engineering groups and university research labs**.  
The results are documented in detailed reports, confirming what we have observed for years:  
**Conventional boundaries are ready to be challenged—by anyone willing to measure honestly and openly.**

We continue to invite all engineers—supporters and skeptics alike—to participate and to judge the data, not the dogma.

## On the State of Engineering

Modern engineering culture often values compliance over curiosity, integration over innovation,  
and “black box” operation over true understanding.

We reject this.  
We are engineers in the true sense:  
**Building, testing, questioning, and sharing—without secrets and without fear.**

---

## An Invitation

**If you are an engineer, scientist, or honest skeptic:**

- Download our tools.
- Measure everything.
- Publish your findings—good, bad, or inconvenient.
- Never take “impossible” for an answer until you have checked every assumption yourself.

---

## Our Promise

We will:

- Keep all our tools and methods open source.
- Publish raw data and calculation chains.
- Welcome all challenges, criticisms, and replications.
- Prioritize truth and transparency above all else.

*Let’s make engineering honest again. Let’s make science open again.  
Let’s measure, not just believe.*

## Side Note: On Industry Response

Not every part of the innovation journey is straightforward—even when your data speaks for itself.

In one case, after achieving a significant performance improvement with our new LED driver technology (independently verified in an industry-certified measurement facility), we found that further collaboration with the measurement partner was suddenly discontinued.

This outcome is, unfortunately, not unique. When genuine innovation challenges established assumptions or existing business interests, progress can meet resistance—even when results are independently validated.

**This is why our commitment to open source tools, transparent data, and community replication is unwavering.**

Science and engineering only move forward when *all* results, not just the convenient ones, are open for public scrutiny and debate.

# BH-Curve ‚Äî Operator Help

**Purpose.** This tab computes and plots the magnetic hysteresis loop \(B(H)\) from two scope inputs:
- **Current through the winding** (I) ‚Üí used to compute \(H = \tfrac{N\,I}{l_e}\).
- **Voltage across the same winding** (V) ‚Üí integrated to flux \(\Phi = \int V\,dt\), then \(B = \tfrac{\Phi}{N\,A_e}\).

Accurate **geometry** (N, \(A_e\), \(l_e\)) and **probe scaling** (shunt/clamp) are mandatory. Deskew compensates instrument delays only‚Äînever to ‚Äútune‚Äù physics.

## 1) What you can set

### Toolbar
- **Acquire & Plot** ‚Äî capture current waveforms and draw B-H.
- **Auto** + **Interval (s)** ‚Äî periodic capture; Interval = refresh period.
- **T=1** + **Avg cycles** ‚Äî extract exactly one electrical period and (optionally) average the last *N* periods to improve SNR.
- **Ref for cycle detect: I / V / Auto** ‚Äî which trace to lock the period on (use the cleaner, more periodic one).
- **üíæ Save PNG / Detailed CSV** ‚Äî export plot and per-sample data (t, V, I, H, B) for traceability.
- **‚≠Æ Clear** ‚Äî clear current plot/history.
- **Plot focus / Data** ‚Äî toggle control visibility and numeric diagnostics pane.

### Core Geometry
- **Turns N** ‚Äî turns of the *sense* winding used in both formulas.
- **Ae (mm¬≤)** ‚Äî effective cross-section area (entered in mm¬≤; converted internally).
- **le (mm)** ‚Äî effective magnetic path length (mm; converted internally).

### Channels & Probe
- **Current channel** ‚Äî scope channel carrying current.
- **Voltage channel** ‚Äî scope channel across the same winding.
- **Deskew Œît (V‚àíI) [¬µs]** ‚Äî positive means V arrives *later* than I; the app delays I by +Œît to align instrumentation paths.
- **Probe type & value**  
  - *Shunt:* enter R (Œ©); current is \(I = V/R\).  
  - *Clamp:* enter sensitivity (A/V); current is \(I = V¬∑(A/V)\).

### Sampling & Processing
- **Mode: NORM / RAW** ‚Äî RAW can deliver higher point density; NORM is most robust.
- **Pts** ‚Äî requested points per acquisition.
- **Stop/Fetch** ‚Äî briefly stop the scope to fetch a stable frame, then resume.
- **Remove DC / Detrend** ‚Äî suppress offsets/drift **before** integration (critical for \(\int V dt\)).
- **Equal aspect / Tight fit / Overlay prev.** ‚Äî plot cosmetics and comparison.

## 2) Signal classes & recommended settings

Use these recipes depending on whether your waveforms are sinusoidal or pulsed/oscillatory. The **Ref**, **T=1**, **Avg**, and **Mode** choices are the big levers.

| Case | Typical waveforms | Ref (cycle detect) | T=1 | Avg cycles | Auto | Mode | Pts | Deskew Œît | Remove DC / Detrend |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| **A. Sinusoidal (50/60 Hz or LF sine)** | I, V ~ sinusoidal | **I** (cleaner zero-cross) | **On** | 4‚Äì16 | On (1‚Äì2 s) | NORM | 1‚Äì5k | 0‚Äì20 ¬µs (as measured) | **On / On** |
| **B. Steady PWM / square (kHz)** | I trapezoid, V pulse & ringing | **I** (if shunt), else V | **On** | 8‚Äì64 (if period-stable) | On (0.2‚Äì1 s) | **RAW** | **‚â•10k** | 0‚Äì2 ¬µs typical | **On / On** |
| **C. Burst / single-shot / flyback** | One pulse + ring-down | **V** (edges are crisp) | **Off** | 1 | **Off** | **RAW** | **Max** | Use prior calibration | **On / On** |
| **D. Aperiodic startup / sweep** | Non-repeating | **V** or **I** (whichever has features) | Off | 1 | Off | RAW | High | Use prior calibration | **On / On** |

> **Rationale**  
> ‚Ä¢ *T=1 + Avg cycles* improves SNR **only** for periodic/stable excitations.  
> ‚Ä¢ For pulses/transients, averaging smears physics ‚Üí keep Avg = 1.  
> ‚Ä¢ RAW + high Pts captures fast edges/ringing needed for accurate \(\int V dt\).

## 3) Cycle detection guidance

1. **Choose Ref wisely.** Use the cleaner, more periodic channel:  
   - With a **shunt**, current (I) is usually best for both sine and PWM.  
   - Voltage (V) has crisp edges; better for bursts, but excessive ringing can confuse period finding.
2. **What T=1 does.** The app detects one period from Ref and resamples both I and V onto that window before computing H and B.  
3. **Aperiodic/Transient.** Turn **T=1 Off**. The app integrates over the whole captured window; ensure the window fully covers the event.

---

## 4) Deskew (Œît) for accuracy

- **Definition in this app:** Œît = (V ‚àí I). If Œît > 0, voltage arrives *later* than current ‚Üí the app delays I to match V.  
- **How to set:** excite the winding with a clean edge or a stable sine. Adjust Œît so **simultaneous physical events align** (edge onset, zero-cross). Do **not** ‚Äútune for pretty loops.‚Äù  
- **Why it matters:** Any relative delay between I and V distorts the loop area (loss) and the apparent coercivity.

---

## 5) Tips per signal class

### A) Sinusoidal
- **Ref = I**, **T=1 On**, **Avg 4‚Äì16**, **Auto On**.  
- Keep **Remove DC/Detrend On** to avoid integrator drift from probe offset.  
- With mains hum, prefer **Stop/Fetch On** for consistent headers.

### B) Steady PWM / Square
- Prefer **RAW** and **high Pts** to resolve edges and ringing.  
- **Ref = I** (if shunt), else **V** when I is noisy.  
- **T=1 On** only if period is stable (constant frequency & duty). Otherwise set **Avg=1**.

### C) Burst / Single-Shot / Flyback
- Set the scope to **Single** acquisition; trigger on the pulse edge.  
- In the app: **Auto Off**, **T=1 Off**, click **Acquire & Plot** once.  
- Use **Detailed CSV** for later verification.  
- If the baseline drifts between runs, re-zero probes (Remove DC/Detrend stay **On**).

### D) Aperiodic Startup / Sweep
- **Auto Off**, **T=1 Off**. Choose **Ref** with the most distinctive features to anchor the time window.  
- Consider **Equal aspect Off** and **Tight fit On** to see the full loop excursion.

## 6) Measurement wiring and scope setup (must-do‚Äôs)

- **Measure across the same winding** for V that you use N for in the geometry. Use a **differential probe** or a truly floating scope input.  
- **Current sense**:  
  - *Shunt*: 4-wire/Kelvin if possible; minimize loop area; know the exact R at operating temperature.  
  - *Clamp*: enter A/V correctly; disable built-in scope scaling (set the probe to 1√ó in the scope if the app handles scaling).  
- **Scope configuration**: DC coupling, sufficient bandwidth (avoid 20 MHz limit for fast pulses), adequate vertical scale without clipping.  
- **Sampling**: choose timebase so one or more complete periods (or the entire pulse) are in view. Increase **Pts** when using short timebases.

---

## 7) Validation & sanity checks

- **Air-core check**: with the core removed, slope \(\frac{B}{H}\) ‚âà \(\mu_0\). Good for geometry sanity.  
- **Datasheet check**: small-signal slope near H‚âà0 should be ‚âà \(\mu_r\mu_0\). Saturation knee should appear at expected H.  
- **Repeatability**: with the same settings, repeated runs should overlay within noise. If not, check trigger stability, deskew, and DC offsets.
- **CSV traceability**: keep **Detailed CSV** when publishing results. It documents (t, V, I, H, B) for independent re-analysis.

---

## 8) Troubleshooting quick list

- **Loop drifting vertically** ‚Üí turn **Remove DC** and **Detrend** on; check probe zero.  
- **Area looks too big/small** ‚Üí verify **Ae, le, N**, and **Deskew Œît**; ensure V is across the correct winding.  
- **Noisy, fuzzy loop** ‚Üí increase **Avg cycles** (only if periodic), increase **Pts**, reduce bandwidth limiting, improve probe grounding.  
- **Cycle detection fails** ‚Üí switch **Ref** from I‚ÜîV, reduce noise, or turn **T=1 Off** for transients.  
- **Integration blow-up on pulses** ‚Üí window the event cleanly (trigger earlier), keep **Detrend** on.

---

## 9) Safety and data integrity

- Deskew compensates instrumentation delay only. **Do not** use it to ‚Äúfix‚Äù physics.  
- Never apply math scalings twice (scope probe settings vs. app). Decide where scaling lives.  
- Use differential probes for high-voltage windings; obey their CAT ratings.  
- Exports include instrument ID and geometry metadata; raw measurements are **never** altered beyond the stated processing (DC removal, detrend, resampling for T=1).
